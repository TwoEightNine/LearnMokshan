<title> About the Mokshan
The Mokshan language is one of two major Finno-Ugric languages, common among the peoples of the right bank of the middle Volga, along with Erzya. This language belongs to the Uralic language family and retains its significance in the culture of the Moksha people. For centuries, the Moksha people continued to use their language in everyday life, passing it on through generations.
<h2> Unique features of the Moksha language
The Mokshan language differs from many European languages in its unique grammar and vocabulary. One of the features of the Mokshan language is agglutination - the process of adding suffixes to the base of a word to form new word forms. This is a characteristic feature of many Finno-Ugric languages. For example, the word "kud" is translated as "house", and "kudftomon" - "without my house" (with the addition of the ending -ftoma to form the derogatory case and the personal ending -n).
An important element of Mokshan grammar is the absence of the category of gender, which is typical for many european languages like French or German. In Moksha, nouns and adjectives do not change by gender, which makes it more laconic in this regard.
Another interesting feature of the Mokshan language is the case system. There are 12 cases in the Mokshan language, each of which has its own meaning and usage. For example, in addition to the nominative, genitive and accusative cases we are accustomed to, there are cases such as lativ (indicates the direction of movement towards something) and abessiv (indicates the absence of something).
<h2> History of the Mokshan language and people
The history of the Mokshan language is inextricably linked with the history of the Moksha people, one of the Finno-Ugric ethnic groups that inhabited the right bank of the middle Volga, the basins of the right tributaries of the Oka and Sura and adjacent areas since ancient times. The first mentions of the "Mordvins"\*, as a union of the Erzya and Moksha, date back to the ancient period. The Moksha, like other Finno-Ugric peoples, were engaged in hunting, fishing, agriculture and crafts, closely interacting with other ethnic groups, such as the Erzya, Mari, Slavs and Tatars.
<hint> The terms "Mordva" and "Mordvin" are often used to generalize the Erzya and Moksha. However, many researchers and representatives of these peoples believe that such terms erase the cultural differences and uniqueness of each ethnic group, so it is recommended to specifically name the people in question.
Over the centuries, the Mokshan language retained its archaic features and at the same time was influenced by neighboring cultures and languages, especially after the Moksha territory was incorporated into the Russian state in the 16th century. Russification had a significant impact on the Mokshan language and culture, which led to the gradual assimilation of the Moksha people. However, the language continued to be used in everyday life, being passed down from generation to generation.
<h2> The resettlement of the Mokshan people
The Moksha people traditionally lived in the territory that is now part of the Republic of Mordovia. However, as a result of historical processes, the Moksha people's settlement covered larger territories. The Moksha people also live in neighboring regions of Russia - in the Nizhny Novgorod, Penza, Ryazan and Ulyanovsk regions.
The migrations of the Moksha people began in the early Middle Ages, when they actively moved along the Volga region, interacting with other peoples. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Moksha people also settled in other regions of Russia, as well as beyond its borders. Today, small communities of Moksha people can be found in countries such as Kazakhstan and Estonia. However, outside of Mordovia and adjacent regions, the Mokshan language is practically not used, giving way to the Russian language.
<h2> The current state of the Mokshan language
Today, the Mokshan language is under threat of extinction. According to the latest Russian census, the number of native speakers is rapidly declining. Native speakers are mainly concentrated in the Republic of Mordovia, as well as in neighboring regions such as the Nizhny Novgorod, Penza and Ulyanovsk regions. However, the younger generation uses the Mokshan language less and less in everyday life, preferring Russian for communication, which casts doubt on the future of the language.

Despite the difficulties, there are efforts to revive the Mokshan language and make it more popular among younger generations. Resources dedicated to learning the Mokshan language are appearing on the Internet, including online courses, mobile apps, and videos explaining the basics of the language. Social media and blogs are becoming important platforms for disseminating information about the Moksha culture and language. Young enthusiasts are creating content in the Mokshan language, which helps draw attention to its preservation.
<h2> Examples in Mokshan
The Mokshan language, despite its uniqueness, remains inaccessible to a wide range of people, even in Russia. Here are some examples:
<list> Greeting in Mokshan: "Shumbrat!" - the equivalent of "Hello!"
<list> The question "How are you?" sounds like "Koda tefne?" or "Koda tevonte?"
<list> The answer to this question could be: "Tsebärsta" - "Good" or "Af päk" - "Not very".
<h2> Conclusion
The Mokshan language is not only a means of communication, but also an important part of the cultural identity of the Moksha people. Its history goes back thousands of years, and despite numerous challenges, the language continues to exist. However, its future depends on whether it is possible to attract attention to the problems of its preservation and make the language popular among new generations. It is important to remember that each language is a unique carrier of culture, and the loss of any language is an irreparable loss for all of humanity.

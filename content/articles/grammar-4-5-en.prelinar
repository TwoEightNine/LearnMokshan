<title> Simple statements: Lessons 4-5
In Mokshan, simple statements like "this is X" are constructed using a demonstrative pronoun and a noun. The basic elements of such a sentence include demonstrative pronouns and nouns without the use of a copula.
<hint> The verb "to be" in the present tense is omitted from such statements in Mokshan. In English, we say "This is a cat" with the explicit verb "is". Differently, Mokshan does not use a linking verb in the present tense to express such statements. Therefore, the phrase "Тя ката" (literally, "This cat") translates as "This is a cat", although the word "is" is missing from the sentence.
To denote an object that is close, the pronoun "тя" is used, which translates as "this". For a distant object, "ся" is used - "that".
Questions to such statements in the Mokshan language are formed using interrogative pronouns. For the question "Who is it?" the pronoun "кие" (who) is used, and for the question "What is it?" - "мезе" (what).
*Example sentences:*
<list> *Кие тя?* – Who is it?
<list> *Тя ломань* — This is a person.
<list> *Мезе ся?* — What is it?
<list> *Ся ката* — This is a cat.
<hint> In Mokshan, the indefiniteness of nouns is expressed differently than in English. There are no articles, like in English "a" or "the", and the lack of indefiniteness is indicated simply by using the noun without any additional endings or words. For example, the sentence "This is a cat" in Mokshan ("Тя ката") requires no articles, indicating that it is talking about some indefinite cat.
Thus, to form a simple affirmative or interrogative sentence in Mokshan, a pronoun and a noun in the required number are sufficient.
